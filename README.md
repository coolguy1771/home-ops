## üìñ Overview

This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using the tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## ‚õµ Kubernetes

There is a template over at [onedr0p/flux-cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template) if you wanted to try and follow along with some of the practices I use here.

### Installation

My cluster is [talos](https://talos.dev) provisioned overtop bare-metal. This is a semi hyper-converged cluster, workloads and block storage are sharing the same available resources on my nodes while I have a separate server for (NFS) file storage.

üî∏ _[Click here](./ansible/) to see my Ansible playbooks and roles._

### Core Components


- [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller): Self-hosted Github runners.
- [cilium/cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium): Internal Kubernetes networking plugin.
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/): Creates SSL certificates for services in my Kubernetes cluster.
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): Automatically manages DNS records from my cluster in a cloud DNS provider.
- [external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/): Managed Kubernetes secrets using [1Password Connect](https://github.com/1Password/connect).
- [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/): Ingress controller to expose HTTP traffic to pods over DNS.
- [rook](https://github.com/rook/rook): Distributed block storage for peristent storage.
- [sops](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/): Managed secrets for Kubernetes, Ansible and Terraform which are commited to Git.
- [tf-controller](https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller): Additional Flux component used to run Terraform from within a Kubernetes cluster.
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync) and [snapscheduler](https://github.com/backube/snapscheduler): Backup and recovery of persistent volume claims.

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches my [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my cluster based on the YAML manifests.

The way Flux works for me here is it will recursively search the [kubernetes/apps](./kubernetes/apps) folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations. Those Flux kustomizations will generally have a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application underneath it which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
üìÅ kubernetes      # Kubernetes cluster defined as code
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ bootstrap     # Flux installation
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ flux          # Main Flux configuration of repository
‚îî‚îÄüìÅ apps          # Apps deployed into my cluster grouped by namespace (see below)
```

### Cluster layout

Below is a a high level look at the layout of how my directory structure with Flux works. In this brief example you are able to see that `authelia` will not be able to run until `glauth` and  `cloudnative-pg` are running. It also shows that the `Cluster` custom resource depends on the `cloudnative-pg` Helm chart. This is needed because `cloudnative-pg` installs the `Cluster` custom resource definition in the Helm chart.

```python
# Key: <kind> :: <metadata.name>
GitRepository :: home-ops-kubernetes
    Kustomization :: cluster
        Kustomization :: cluster-apps
            Kustomization :: cluster-apps-authelia
                DependsOn:
                    Kustomization :: cluster-apps-glauth
                    Kustomization :: cluster-apps-cloudnative-pg-cluster
                HelmRelease :: authelia
            Kustomization :: cluster-apps-glauth
                HelmRelease :: glauth
            Kustomization :: cluster-apps-cloudnative-pg
                HelmRelease :: cloudnative-pg
            Kustomization :: cluster-apps-cloudnative-pg-cluster
                DependsOn:
                    Kustomization :: cluster-apps-cloudnative-pg
                Cluster :: postgres
```

- HAProxy configured on my `Opnsense` router for the Kubernetes Control Plane Load Balancer.
- Cilium configured with `loadbalancerIPs` to expose Kubernetes services with their own IP over BGP (w/ECMP) which is configured on my router.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Dependencies

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are selfhosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about two things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios and (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not.

The alternative solution to these two problems would be to host a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud and deploy applications like [HCVault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden), [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/), and [Gatus](https://gatus.io/). However, maintaining another cluster and monitoring another group of workloads is a lot more time and effort than I am willing to put in.

### Ingress Controller

Over WAN, I have port forwarded ports `80` and `443` to the load balancer IP of my ingress controller that's running in my Kubernetes cluster.

[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) works as a proxy to hide my homes WAN IP and also as a firewall. When not on my home network, all the traffic coming into my ingress controller on port `80` and `443` comes from Cloudflare. In `Opnsense` I block all IPs not originating from the [Cloudflares list of IP ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/).

### Internal DNS

[CoreDNS](https://github.com/coredns/coredns) is deployed on my `Opnsense` router and listening on `:53`. All DNS queries for _**my**_ domains are forwarded to [k8s_gateway](https://github.com/ori-edge/k8s_gateway) that is running in my cluster. With this setup `k8s_gateway` has direct access to my clusters ingresses and services and serves DNS for them in my internal network. One additional thing is that I have `dnsmasq` running on `Opnsense` on port `5353` to only have it provide a host file for `CoreDNS`, this way I can have DNS for devices on my network.

### Ad Blocking

The upstream server in CoreDNS is set to NextDNS which provides me with AdBlocking for all devices on my network.

### External DNS

[external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) is deployed in my cluster and configure to sync DNS records to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). The only ingresses `external-dns` looks at to gather DNS records to put in `Cloudflare` are ones that I explicitly set an annotation of `external-dns.home.arpa/enabled: "true"`

üî∏ _[Click here](./terraform/cloudflare) to see how else I manage Cloudflare with Terraform._

### Dynamic DNS

My home IP can change at any given time and in order to keep my WAN IP address up to date on Cloudflare. I have deployed a [CronJob](./kubernetes/apps/networking/ddns) in my cluster, this periodically checks and updates the `A` record `ipv4.domain.tld`.

## ü§ù Gratitude and Thanks

Thanks to all the people who donate their time to the [Kubernetes @Home](https://discord.gg/k8s-at-home) Discord community. A lot of inspiration for my cluster comes from the people that have shared their clusters using the [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/topics/k8s-at-home) GitHub topic. Be sure to check out the [Kubernetes @Home search](https://nanne.dev/k8s-at-home-search/) for ideas on how to deploy applications or get ideas on what you can deploy.
